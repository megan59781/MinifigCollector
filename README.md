# LEGO® Minifigure Finder and Collector App

**Minifig Detective** is a new Flutter app that helps us LEGO® collectors scan (Series 25 and onwards) minifigure QR codes to identify what's inside before buying.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Scan QR Codes** on LEGO® minifigure boxes to identify contents.
- ✅ **Track Your Collection** — mark which minifigures you already own.
- 🚫 **Avoid Unwanted Figures or Duplicates** — select figures you'd prefer not to get.
- 🎲 **Keep the Surprise** — option for the scans to only tell you if a figure is on your "avoid list" without revealing its identity, preserving the excitement of collecting.

Whether you're a serious collector or just want to avoid duplicates, **Minifig Detective**  helps you make smarter collecting decisions.
